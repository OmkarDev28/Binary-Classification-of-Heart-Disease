# Binary-Classification-of-Heart-Disease

Overview

This project is a machine learning-based model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a binary classification approach (presence or absence of heart disease). The model is trained on a dataset containing various health-related parameters.

Features

- Binary Classification: Predicts whether a person has heart disease (1) or not (0).

- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data for training.

- Feature Engineering: Utilizes medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to measure performance.

Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (recommended for running the model)

- Required libraries:

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

- Testing with additional ML models.

- eployment as a web application.
